# Fancy scrolling Zflip
Recreating fancy scrolling(using 200 img with 20 fps). The idea is to create an animation just like a sequence of images in rapid succession.By synchronizing each frame to the userâ€™s scroll position, we can play the animation as the user scrolls down (or back up) the page.
